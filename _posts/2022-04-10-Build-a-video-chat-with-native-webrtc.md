After watching a WebRTC toturial video, I decided to write this article to take explain it with more details. This article will guide you and explain how to build native WebRTC using Socket.io, express, and React based on the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhyY8LdAQHU&t=1s), GitHub code can be access from [here](https://github.com/coding-with-chaim/native-webrtc)

In the previous article, I go over some important concepts in WebRTC. They are quite essential to this article and might be repeated.

# Set up

Since WebRTC needs a signaling server, this app needs a server for signaling and a front-end client. We use express and socket.io to build the signaling server, and React as the front-end client.
