## Build a free blog with gitHub pages

After setting up my own portfolio, I always think of having a GitHub blog. However, I didn't know how until I happen to read this [blog](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html). It tells you how to set up a blog with Github. A really nice one. If you are curious about setting up gitHub pages, you must check it.  
Besides, Github have a quick [walkthrough](https://pages.github.com/). Also, the official site offers more [details](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
