There is a great WebRTC toturial. This article is a kind of study notes. It aims to understand WebRTC with a real , rather than pure concepts discussed in the previous article. The toturial use express to build the signalling server with the help of Socket.io. It uses the native WebRTC in the client side (React app).

# Set up

Since WebRTC needs a signaling server, this app needs a server for signaling and a front-end client. We use express and socket.io to build the signaling server, and React as the front-end client.
